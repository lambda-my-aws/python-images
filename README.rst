Yet another docker source
=========================

Some images online, ie. python, which I used until now, are
* 1. massive in size
* 2. contain vulnerabilities.


Amazon Linux
------------

Amazon Linux is not the latest of the latest, however, it comes with no vulnerability, therefore makes a great candidate
base image OS for adding runtimes.

So I decided to use amazonlinux base image and install some runtime engines from amazon themselves to use in projects.
